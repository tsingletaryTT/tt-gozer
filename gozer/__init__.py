# 0.2.0 covers everything landed since the initial 0.1.0 implementation:
# read-only `status`, the append-only history log, the optional reconcile
# timer, and `acquire --owner-pid`. Minor rather than patch because 0.1.0
# also shipped the exit 12 -> 15 change, which is a breaking contract change
# for anything matching on "device still open" (see README's exit-code table).
__version__ = "0.2.0"
